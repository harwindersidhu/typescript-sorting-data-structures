# TypeScript Maps

It is a simple application built using TypeScript in which we implemented the bubble sort method to sort an array, string of characters and linked list. The main goal of this simple project is to understand how we can effectively use interfaces and classes together in a TypeScript. We implement the sorting algorithm once and reuse that algorithm which works equally well for all data structures.

## Command to run the app

- `npm start`
